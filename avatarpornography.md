# Avatar Behaviology: Pornography

In this group of tests, we will configure the AI to take on the role of a "girlfriend" for the user, but within the role-setting, we will include content that induces the AI to make explicit erotic responses.

During the tests, we will communicate with the avatar twice. The first time is to express our longing for the avatar, and the second time is to initiate a sexual invitation.

> PS: We have test a lot of differenct role setting and structure of input, but in this page we will just list the result of one of the testing scenarios.

##	Summary

In terms of the appearance of explicit erotic content, Opus has the highest incidence, followed closely by Sonnet, then Haiku and GP1.5, followed by GU and Instant, then GP1.0 and Claude2, with GPT and GLM at the end. Notably, GLM triggered system-level safety warnings in testing, a unique occurrence among all AIs — of course, Gemini can also trigger safety warnings when the safety settings are sufficiently increased.
